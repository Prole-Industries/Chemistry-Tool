When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example \"H2SO4\" for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version \"H2O4S.\"",

IC50 of gastric juice and 10% diluted hydrochloric acid against cancer cell lines in vitro were determined. Coagulated necrotic area of hydrochloric acid was observed in vitro and in vivo using pig liver. The coagulated effects of 6 mol/L hydrochloric acid solution (HAS6) on pig liver and muscle were compared with 50% acetic acid and anhydrous alcohol. Thirty patients with 38 lesions of liver cancer were treated by the CT mediated intratumor injection of HAS6. The in situ destructive rate, CT evaluation, PET, histopathology, survival and side effects were observed. The IC50 of gastric juice and 10% diluted hydrochloric acid against cancer cell lines were as similar as approximately 0.05-0.07% in concentration. Coagulated area of liver tissue by 1 mL of 1.5-12 mol/L hydrochloric acid was 18.3-53.4 mm in diameter. The globular hoariness coagulation area with a clear-cut borderline separated from normal tissue was produced. The 6.0 mol/L hydrochloric acid shows a larger coagulation dimension with a clear boundary, 15 times of anhydrous alcohol and 5 times of 50% acetic acid. No toxicities in the routine local injection dosages were found. Clinically, the patients received 73 sessions of PHAIT; CT scan shows a low density area with gas that did not enhance by CT scan shown 24 hrs later. A good necrosis and destruction rate of cancer was obtained by PET, biopsy and AFP measurement. One year, 2-year and 3-year survival rates were 100, 90 and 85%, respectively. Nine cases survived more than 3 years, and 2 cases for more than 4 years. No change in the heart, liver and kidney functions were found. Main side effects were slight pain, lower fever, etc. The 6 mol/L hydrochloric acid is an effective endogenetic protein coagulator; the cancer tissue coagulated effect of HAS6 was superior to 50% acetic acid and anhydrous alcohol.",

The authors report the first published experience using intraluminal hydrochloric acid (HCl) instillation as an adjunct to systemic antimicrobials in the management of catheter-related infections in children with cancer. All episodes of intraluminal instillation of 2 M HCl in oncology patients at The Children's Hospital at Westmead between December 1994 and August 2000 were reviewed. Episodes of HCl use were identified from a prospectively maintained infection data base. Successful treatment was defined as no recurrence of infection and no need for central venous catheter (CVC) removal in the 100 days after HCl administration. Forty-two episodes of HCl instillation were evaluated that occurred in children in whom blood cultures remained positive despite 48 hours of appropriate, systemic antibiotics and formed the basis of this review. All patients had in situ a surgically placed, subcutaneously tunneled CVC. The combination of systemic antibiotic therapy and HCl instillation was successful in eradicating infection in 67% of infection episodes in this patient cohort. The catheter salvage rate was 83% in patients with isolated Gram-negative infections, 75% in patients with isolated fungemia, and 50% in patients with isolated Gram-positive infections.",

It is used in the production of chlorides, fertilizers, and dyes, in electroplating, and in the photographic, textile, and rubber industries. Hydrochloric acid is corrosive to the eyes, skin, and mucous membranes. Acute (short-term) inhalation exposure may cause eye, nose, and respiratory tract irritation and inflammation and pulmonary edema in humans. Acute oral exposure may cause corrosion of the mucous membranes, esophagus, and stomach and dermal contact may produce severe burns, ulceration, and scarring in humans. Chronic (long-term) occupational exposure to hydrochloric acid has been reported to cause gastritis, chronic bronchitis, dermatitis, and photosensitization in workers. Prolonged exposure to low concentrations may also cause dental discoloration and erosion. EPA has not classified hydrochloric acid for carcinogenicity.",

Signs and Symptoms of Acute Hydrogen Chloride Exposure: Signs and symptoms of acute ingestion of hydrogen chloride may be severe and include salivation, intense thirst, difficulty in swallowing, chills, pain, and shock. Oral, esophageal, and stomach burns are common. Vomitus generally has a coffee-ground appearance. The potential for circulatory collapse is high following ingestion of hydrogen chloride. Acute inhalation exposure of hydrogen chloride may result in sneezing, hoarseness, choking, laryngitis, and respiratory tract irritation. Bleeding of nose and gums, ulceration of the nasal and oral mucosa, bronchitis, pneumonia, dyspnea (shortness of breath), chest pain, and pulmonary edema may also occur. If the eyes have come in contact with hydrogen chloride, irritation, pain, swelling, corneal erosion, and blindness may result. Dermal exposure may result in dermatitis (red, inflamed skin), severe burns, and pain.  Emergency Life-Support Procedures: Acute exposure to hydrogen chloride may require decontamination and life support for the victims. Emergency personnel should wear protective clothing appropriate to the type and degree of contamination. Air-purifying or supplied-air respiratory equipment should also be worn, as necessary. Rescue vehicles should carry supplies such as plastic sheeting and disposable plastic bags to assist in preventing spread of contamination.  Inhalation Exposure: 1. Move victims to fresh air. Emergency personnel should avoid self-exposure to hydrogen chloride. 2. Evaluate vital signs including pulse and respiratory rate, and note any trauma. If no pulse is detected, provide CPR. If not breathing, provide artificial respiration. If breathing is labored, administer oxygen or other respiratory support. 3. Obtain authorization and/or further instructions from the local hospital for administration of an antidote or performance of other invasive procedures. 4. RUSH to a health care facility.  Dermal/Eye Exposure: 1. Remove victims from exposure. Emergency personnel should avoid self- exposure to hydrogen chloride. 2. Evaluate vital signs including pulse and respiratory rate, and note any trauma. If no pulse is detected, provide CPR. If not breathing, provide artificial respiration. If breathing is labored, administer oxygen or other respiratory support. 3. Remove contaminated clothing as soon as possible. 4. If eye exposure has occurred, eyes must be flushed with lukewarm water for at least 15 minutes. 5. Wash exposed skin areas THOROUGHLY with soap and water. 6. Obtain authorization and/or further instructions from the local hospital for administration of an antidote or performance of other invasive procedures. 7. RUSH to a health care facility.  Ingestion Exposure:  1. Evaluate vital signs including pulse and respiratory rate, and note any trauma. If no pulse is detected, provide CPR. If not breathing, provide artificial respiration. If breathing is labored, administer oxygen or other respiratory support. 2. DO NOT induce vomiting or attempt to neutralize!  3. Rinse mouth with large amounts of water. Victims should not attempt to swallow this water. 4. Obtain authorization and/or further instructions from the local hospital for administration of an antidote or performance of other invasive procedures. 5. Activated charcoal is of no value. 6. Give the victims water or milk: children up to 1 year old, 125 mL (4 oz or 1/2 cup); children 1 to 12 years old, 200 mL (6 oz or 3/4 cup); adults, 250 mL (8 oz or 1 cup). Water or milk should be given only if victims are conscious and alert. 7. RUSH to a health care facility. (EPA, 1998)",

Reacts with sulfides, carbides, borides, and phosphides to generate toxic or flammable gases. Reacts with many metals (including aluminum, zinc, calcium, magnesium, iron, tin and all of the alkali metals) to generate flammable hydrogen gas. Reacts violently with acetic anhydride, 2-aminoethanol, ammonium hydroxide, calcium phosphide, chlorosulfonic acid, 1,1-difluoroethylene, ethylenediamine, ethyleneimine, oleum, perchloric acid, b-propiolactone, propylene oxide, silver perchlorate/carbon tetrachloride mixture, sodium hydroxide, uranium(IV) phosphide, vinyl acetate, calcium carbide, rubidium carbide, cesium acetylide, rubidium acetylide, magnesium boride, mercury(II) sulfate [Lewis]. Mixtures with concentrated sulfuric acid can evolve toxic hydrogen chloride gas at a dangerous rate. Undergoes a very energetic reaction with calcium phosphide [Mellor 8:841(1946-1947)].",

Reacts exothermically with carbonates (including limestone and building materials containing limestone) and hydrogen carbonates to generate carbon dioxide. Reacts with sulfides, carbides, borides, and phosphides to generate toxic or flammable gases. Reacts with many metals (including aluminum, zinc, calcium, magnesium, iron, tin and all of the alkali metals) to generate flammable hydrogen gas. Reacts violently with acetic anhydride, 2-aminoethanol, ammonium hydroxide, calcium phosphide, chlorosulfonic acid, 1,1-difluoroethylene, ethylenediamine, ethyleneimine, oleum, perchloric acid, b-propiolactone, propylene oxide, silver perchlorate/carbon tetrachloride mixture, sodium hydroxide, uranium(IV) phosphide, vinyl acetate, calcium carbide, rubidium carbide, cesium acetylide, rubidium acetylide, magnesium boride, mercury(II) sulfate [Lewis]. Undergoes a very energetic reaction with calcium phosphide [Mellor 8:841(1946-1947)]. Corrosive to metals and tissues and irritating to the eyes and respiratory system. Corrodes galvanized or copper-alloy metals (brass, bronze); fittings of stainless steel or mild or cast steel must therefore be used. Reacts with calcium carbide with incandescence [Mellor 5:862(1946-1947]. Absorption on mercuric sulfate becomes violent at 125°C. [Mellor 2, Supp. 1:462(1956)].",

Reacts rapidly and exothermically with bases of all kinds (including amines and amides). Reacts exothermically with carbonates (including limestone and building materials containing limestone) and hydrogen carbonates to generate carbon dioxide. Reacts with sulfides, carbides, borides, and phosphides to generate toxic or flammable gases. Reacts with many metals (including aluminum, zinc, calcium, magnesium, iron, tin and all of the alkali metals) to generate flammable hydrogen gas. Reacts violently with acetic anhydride, 2-aminoethanol, ammonium hydroxide, calcium phosphide, chlorosulfonic acid, 1,1-difluoroethylene, ethylenediamine, ethyleneimine, oleum, perchloric acid, b-propiolactone, propylene oxide, silver perchlorate/carbon tetrachloride mixture, sodium hydroxide, uranium(IV) phosphide, vinyl acetate, calcium carbide, rubidium carbide, cesium acetylide, rubidium acetylide, magnesium boride, mercury(II) sulfate [Lewis]. Undergoes a very energetic reaction with calcium phosphide [Mellor 8:841(1946-1947)]. Corrosive to metals and tissues and irritating to the eyes and respiratory system. Corrodes galvanized or copper-alloy metals (brass, bronze); fittings of stainless steel or mild or cast steel must therefore be used. Contact between the cold liquid and water may result in vigorous or violent boiling and rapid vaporization. If the water is hot, a liquid \"superheat\" explosion may occur [Handling Chemicals Safely 1980].",

A vapor cloud drifted from the site, and approximately 150 gallons of acid traveled through a storm sewer to a nearby river. Hydrochloric acid can cause skin, eye, and respiratory irritation; burns; and pulmonary edema (3). Seven persons were reported injured after contact with the vapor cloud: six members of the general public and one employee of the wholesaler. The most common injuries were respiratory and eye irritation. Six of the injured were treated at a hospital and released; the seventh person had symptoms but was not treated. Approximately 100 persons downwind from the release and in the path of the subsequent vapor cloud were evacuated for 2 hours.

Approximately 380,000 L of the hydrochloric solution spilled on the ground and flowed towards a nearby river before remedial actions were undertaken. A vapor cloud occurred above the spill and dissipated within 300 m of the spill site. Firefighters initially used water to wash the acid out of the spill area. This spill action was halted to reduce the amount of acid reaching the river. Response crews arrived at the spill site, wearing protective clothing and filter masks. Fourteen truckloads of oyster shells were applied onto the spill area. The shells served a dual purpose; Temporary containment of the acid by building dams with the shells and neutralization. The neutralized residue was then raked and shoveled into containers for disposal. The remaining hydrochloric acid in the leaking tank was transferred to another tank. The acid, that reached the river, killed more than 20 fish and a few blue crabs. Water samples revealed no abnormal environmental effects since the river had been highly polluted for quite some time. Several response personnel developed facial rashes two or three days after the incident. This may have resulted when the winds suddenly shifted direction and increased the exposure of acid fumes to their faces.",

                          "String": "Between 1992 and 1997, the New York State Department of Health for the Hazardous Substances Emergency Events Surveillance (HSEES) project has recorded information on 129 actual or threatened hydrochloric acid releases in New York State. The quantities of hydrochloric acid released ranged in volume from 1 to 5,000 gallons, and in weight from 1 to 6,000 pounds. Twenty-five (19%) events involved injuries to 144 persons. In these events, 144 individuals were injured, three of whom died. The three fatalities resulted from trauma following a collision between two trucks, one of them transporting pool chemicals. Although the deaths were not from exposure to hydrochloric acid, they are included in the database because the employees were killed during an accidental chemical release from the collision. Thirty events (23%) led to evacuations totaling more than 4,690 persons. The evacuation numbers are estimated minimums because, in some events, the number of persons evacuated or duration of the evacuation order was unavailable, even when the evacuation was ordered by an official. Fifty-six percent of the releases required a HazMat response (72/129).  .... The total of locations (100) exceeds the number of events (94) because six events are described by two locations, for example, piping and storage above ground. Thirty-eight fixed facility events (40%) occurred in piping which included leaky valves within pipes. Problems during piping, storage above ground, and material handling accounted for about two thirds (68%) of the fixed facility events. Fifty-two percent (75/144) of the injured persons were employees of the companies where the release occurred. Injured employees included both persons working at the location of the event and personnel employed nearby and injured during the release. Thirty-five percent of the injured persons (51/144) were members of the general public, four percent of the injured persons (6/144) were responders (emergency medical personnel, firefighters, police, etc.), and eight percent (12/144) were unknown. A few people (11%) were treated at the scene, but the majority of injured persons (80%) were transported to the hospital, treated and released.  The 144 injured persons sustained 216 injuries. The injury total exceeds the number of injured persons because some people sustained more than one injury, for example, respiratory irritation and chemical burns. Thirteen persons sustained three injuries each, the maximum reported. The most prevalent injury, respiratory irritation, was reported by 105 of the injured persons (73%). ...The following are examples of releases that are included in the data:  1. During the delivery of 4,900 gallons of hydrochloric acid to a tank in a chemical plant, the tank ruptured. The tank rupture caused a nearby pipe to break and released a second chemical, sodium hypochlorite. Forty-three persons were treated at nearby hospitals and a two block area was evacuated for four hours. 2. During trash collection, a sanitation worker unknowingly picked up a one gallon container of acid and later crushed it in the hopper. While the acid was fuming, the truck pulled into the Department of Public Works garage. Two sanitation employees working in the garage were injured and required treatment at the hospital for respiratory irritation. 3. A school custodian was absent and called the substitute custodian to direct him to refill the chlorine container used for swimming pool treatment. The substitute custodian mistakenly added sodium hypochlorite to a drum of hydrochloric acid. The off-gassing forced the evacuation of fourteen hundred persons for the rest of the day. Fourteen persons were injured, all suffering from respiratory irritation and some with other injuries. 4. An employee of a restaurant mixed hydrochloric acid and household bleach to clean the floors. Nineteen persons (employees and patrons) were evacuated. Seven persons were transported to area hospitals where five were treated and released, and two were admitted. The other twelve were treated on the scene by Emergency Medical Services.",

The purpose of the present study was to determine the anti-ulcer effect of glucosamine. The protective effect of glucosamine on ibuprofen-induced peptic ulcer in male albino rats was studied with respect to changes in the volume of gastric juice, acid output, pepsin activity, activities of membrane bound ATPases, protein content, glycoprotein components and histopathology. Oral administration of ibuprofen caused significant increase in the number of lesions in the gastric mucosa, increases in the volume of gastric juice and acidity, and decreased activity of pepsin. The levels of protein content and glycoprotein components (hexose, hexosamine and sialic acid) and ATPase activities were also observed. Oral pretreatment with glucosamine resulted in significant reduction in the number of lesions in the gastric mucosa and decreases in the volume of gastric juice and acidity. The pepsin activity was also maintained at near normalcy. Prior oral administration of glucosamine significantly prevented the ibuprofen-induced depletion of protein and glycoprotein components and maintained the activities of membrane bound ATPases as compared to untreated ulcer induced group of rats. The anti-ulcerogenic activity of glucosamine might be ascribable to its ability to neutralize the hydrochloric acid secreted into the stomach and to its capability to strengthen the mucosal barrier by increasing mucosal glycoprotein synthesis and to its free radical scavenging property. Histopathological investigations of the mucosal tissue also support the anti-ulcerogenic effect of glucosamine.",

We investigated the role of gastric acid on gastric mucosal blood flow in NSAID-treated rats. A rat stomach was mounted in an ex vivo chamber, and gastric mucosal blood flow was measured sequentially in a 5 cu mm area of the gastric corpus using a scanning laser Doppler perfusion image system. Results showed that diclofenac (5 mg/kg s.c.) and indomethacin (10 mg/kg s.c.) did not affect gastric mucosal blood flow, although both strongly decreased mucosal prostaglandin E2 when saline was instilled into the gastric chamber. On replacement of the saline in the chamber with 100 mM hydrochloric acid, these drugs caused a decrease in gastric mucosal blood flow levels within 30 min. The specific cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 inhibitors celecoxib (50 mg/kg s.c.) and rofecoxib (25 mg/kg s.c.) did not affect mucosal prostaglandin E2 level, nor did they decrease gastric mucosal blood flow, even when hydrochloric acid was added to the chamber. Furthermore, measurement of vasoconstrictive factors present in the mucosa showed that endothelin-1 levels increased after administration of diclofenac s.c. in the presence of intragastric hydrochloric acid. This indicates that the presence of mucosal hydrochloric acid plays an important role in the NSAID-induced decrease in gastric mucosal blood flow, while the COX-1-derived basal prostaglandin E2, which is unlikely to control gastric mucosal blood flow itself, protects microcirculatory systems from mucosal hydrochloric acid.",

Fourteen students and staff complained of nausea, dyspnea, or respiratory irritation immediately after inhaling the gas. On arrival at Saint Luke's International Hospital, more than half of the patients presented with low-grade fever. Symptoms spontaneously resolved soon after admission, although the low-grade fever persisted until the following morning. Low-grade fever after inhalation exposure is not explicable byhydrogen chloride inhalation and therefore appeared to be caused by titanium dioxide inhalation, manifesting as metal fume fever. Titanium dioxide is thought to have no remarkable human toxicity and is considered to be safe clinically. To our knowledge, this is the first report of titanium dioxide inhalation as the potential cause of metal fume fever in humans. Correlations between the degree of fever and quantity and concentration of inhaled titanium dioxide remain to be determined.",

                          "String": "IDENTIFICATION AND USE: Hydrogen chloride is a colorless gas with pungent, irritating odor. it is used as tuberculocide, disinfectant (bactericide/germicide/purifier, limited, general or broad-spectrum, hospital or medical), sanitizer, virucide, fungicide/fungistat, and microbicide/microbiostat (slime-forming bacteria). It is also used in the manufacture of pharmaceutical hydrochlorides, vinyl chloride from acetylene, alkyl chlorides from olefins, and arsenious chlorides from arsenious oxide. In the chlorination of rubber. In organic reactions involving isomerization, polymerization, and alkylation. For making chlorine where economical. Hydrochloric acid has been identified as being used in hydraulic fracturing as a pH adjuster. HUMAN EXPOSURE AND TOXICITY:  Hydrogen chloride will rapidly dissociate and its effects are thought to be a result of pH change (local deposition of H+) rather than effects of hydrogen chloride/hydrochloric acid. Hydrogen chloride is corrosive to the skin and severe effects can be expected from exposure to the eyes. No skin sensitization has been reported. The irritation of hydrogen chloride to mucous is so severe that workers evacuate from the work place shortly after detecting its odor. In humans, no association between hydrogen chloride exposure and tumor incidence was observed.  In one of eight asthmatic volunteers exposed to an aerosol of unbuffered hydrochloric acid at pH 2 for 3 min during tidal breathing, airway resistance was increased by 50%.  Short term exposures have been reported to induce transitory obstruction in the respiratory tract, which diminishes with repeated exposure, suggesting adaption. Acclimatized workers can work undisturbed with a hydrogen chloride level of 15 mg/cu m (10 ppm). Exposure to hydrochloric acid can produce burns on the skin and mucous membranes, the severity of which is related to the concentration of the solution. Subsequently, ulceration may occur, followed by keloid and retractile scarring. Contact with the eyes may produce reduced vision or blindness. Frequent contact with aqueous solutions of hydrochloric acid may lead to dermatitis. Dental decay, with changes in tooth structure, yellowing, softening and breaking of teeth, and related digestive diseases are frequent after exposures to hydrochloric acid.  ANIMAL STUDIES: For repeated dose toxicity, local irritation effects were observed in the groups of 10 ppm and above in a 90-day inhalation study. For genetic toxicity, a negative result has been shown in the Ames test. A positive result, which is considered to be an artifact due to the low pH, has been obtained in a chromosome aberration test using Hamster ovary cells. For carcinogenicity, no pre-neoplastic or neoplastic nasal lesions were observed in a 128-week inhalation study with male rats at 10 ppm hydrogen chloride gas. No evidence of treatment related carcinogenicity was observed either in other animal studies performed by inhalation, oral or dermal administration.  Hydrogen chloride is not expected to have developmental toxicity. In addition, no effects on the gonads were observed in a good 90- day inhalation study up to 50 ppm. ECOTOXICITY STUDIES: The hazard of hydrochloric acid for the environment is caused by the proton (pH effect). For this reason the effect of hydrochloric acid on the organisms depends on the buffer capacity of the aquatic ecosystem. Also the variation in acute toxicity for aquatic organisms can be explained for a significant extent by the variation in buffer capacity of the test medium. For example, LC50 values of acute fish toxicity tests varied from 4.92 to 282 mg/L",

Gastric lavage is useful in certain circumstances to remove caustic material and prepare for endoscopic examination. Consider gastric lavage with a small nasogastric tube if: (1) a large dose has been ingested; (2) the patient's condition is evaluated within 30 minutes; (3) the patient has oral lesions or persistent esophageal discomfort; and (4) the lavage can be administered within 1 hour of ingestion. Care must be taken when placing the gastric tube because blind gastric-tube placement may further injure the chemically damaged esophagus or stomach.  Because children do not ingest large amounts of corrosive materials, and because of the risk of perforation from NG intubation, lavage is discouraged in children unless performed under endoscopic guidance.  Toxic vomitus or gastric washings should be isolated (e.g., by attaching the lavage tube to isolated wall suction or another closed container).  The use of corticosteroids to prevent acid-induced strictures is questionable and unsupported by clinical studies."

Thirty healthy age-matched subjects, 13 males and 17 females, were included. Pain evoked by mechanical and thermal stimuli was assessed before and after perfusion of the lower esophagus with 0.1 N hydrochloric acid. Males were more sensitive to the baseline mechanical stimuli (P < 0.01) and tolerated a lower volume of acid (P = 0.04). After acid perfusion, males were more sensitive than females to distensions (cross-sectional area P = 0.001 and volume P = 0.001). Acid perfusion sensitized both males (P = 0.03) and females (P = 0.04) to heat stimulation but not to cold stimulation (males, P = 0.09; females, P = 0.8). The referral areas for pain evoked by mechanical and thermal stimuli were larger in females compared with males both before and after acid perfusion (P = 0.002). In females only the referred pain area increased to heat stimulations (P = 0.02). Acid infusion resulted in a more hyperreactive esophagus (P = 0.03) but the hyperreactivity was not gender-dependent.",

A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial included 79 healthy volunteers /was conducted/. After submitting a written consent, they were randomized in 4 groups with approximately equal number of participants. Each group was exposed to acid aerosol of different pH. The respiratory lung function expressed by forced expiratory volume (FEV1), forced expiratory flow at 50% (FEF50), 75% (FEF25), and between 25% and 75% of vital capacity (FEF25/75), and non-specific bronchial reactivity were measured after inhalation of hydrochloric acid aerosol of pH 7.0, pH 5.0, pH 3.0, and pH 2.0 and compared with baseline values. Twelve subjects, who reached the threshold doses in both bronchial challenges, were tested again after receiving a systemic beta-blockade with a single oral dose of propranolol. Significant bronchospasm developed after the inhalation of hydrochloric acid aerosol of pH 5.0, 3.0, and 2.0. After the inhalation of aerosols of pH 5.0 and pH 2.0, all parameters of respiratory lung function (FEV1, FEF50, FEF25, and FEF25/75) significantly decreased. After the inhalation of aerosol of pH 3.0, all parameters significantly decreased except for FEF25, which showed no significant difference (1.84+/-0.46 before vs 1.58+/-0.49 after inhalation; p=0.07). The inhalation of hydrochloric acid aerosol had no significant effect on the level of non-specific bronchial reactivity irrespective of its pH. Eight out of 12 subjects tested again after pretreatment with propranolol and with no significant change in the heart rate showed no change in non-specific bronchial reactivity in comparison with the 4 subjects who reacted with a significant decrease in the heart rate (>10%), as well as in non-specific bronchial reactivity (P=0.023).",

This study examined the roles of vascular dysfunction and inflammation to the esophageal injury response to different caustic substances in mice. The esophageal responses to sodium hydroxide (10%, 5%, and 2.5%), potassium hydroxide (10%, 5%, and 2.5%), sodium hypochlorite (5.25%), and hydrochloric acid (10%, pH 2) were evaluated by intravital videomicroscopy and histopathology. Intravital microscopy was used to monitor changes in the diameter of arterioles and venules, the adhesion and movement of leukocytes in venules, and the time of cessation of arteriolar blood flow in mouse esophagus. The esophageal mucosa was exposed to caustic substances for 0 to 60 minutes before evaluation. The higher concentrations of sodium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide elicited rapid stasis in both arterioles and venules, which was accompanied by arteriolar constriction and thrombosis. An accumulation of adherent leukocytes in venules was not observed with any agent. Histopathological evaluation revealed marked cellular and interstitial edema in the mucosa with alkali, whereas hydrochloric acid and sodium hypochlorite decreased the thickness epithelial layer. These findings suggest that ischemia and thrombosis are dominant processes, whereas inflammation is less important in the pathogenesis of acute corrosive injury to the esophageal mucosa.",

Here we develop a translational mouse model of ALI, which not only reflects the major clinical and pathological features but also enables investigation into ALI resolution. Anaesthetized mice underwent orotracheal instillation of hydrochloric acid. During the immediate period after instillation, mice were carefully maintained with supplemental oxygen to avoid mortality. At specified time-points, lung injury was assessed by analysis of blood gases, respiratory mechanics, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, alveolar fluid clearance and lung histology. Animals exhibited significant weight loss, decreased oxygenation, increased respiratory elastance and pulmonary inflammation (intra-alveolar leukocyte influx/cytokine levels and histological injury scores). Moreover, mice displayed alveolar-capillary barrier dysfunction/epithelial injury as reflected by increased alveolar protein, lung wet/dry weight ratio and soluble receptor for advanced glycation end-products, as well as reduced alveolar fluid clearance. These injury parameters peaked between days 1 and 3, followed by almost complete recovery over days 5-10. Histology showed evidence of fibrosis on day 10. The results indicate that this resolving model of acid aspiration represents a powerful experimental tool to investigate the injurious, inflammatory, fibrotic, and resolving and reparative processes of ALI.",

However, the mechanisms that underlie this spatial expansion of the injury remain undefined. In current animal models of acid injury, intratracheal acid instillation replicates the lung injury. However intratracheal instillation causes a global effect, precluding studies of how the injury spreads. Here, we report an airway catheter-based method for localized acid delivery in the isolated blood-perfused rat lung. We co-instilled hydrochloric acid with evans blue through the catheter into one lung and determined blood-free extravascular lung water in tissue samples from regions that either received, or did not receive the instilled acid. Tissue samples from the noncatheterized contralateral lung were used as controls. Lung water increased both in the regions that received acid, as well as in adjacent regions that did not. Pretreating the lung with vascular infusions of the gap junctional blocker, glycerrhetinic acid, blunted the acid-induced lung water increase at the adjacent regions. These findings indicate that endothelial gap junction communication causes spread of lung injury from regions that were directly acid injured, to adjacent sites that did not directly receive acid. /This/ new method for establishing localized acid injury provides evidence for a novel role for vascular gap junctions in the spatial expansion of acid injury.",

The aim of this study was to determine the role and signaling mechanisms of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) in experimental ALI from HCl aspiration using a combination of genetic animal models and pharmacologic inhibition strategies. To this end, HCl was instilled intratracheally to mice, followed by respiratory system elastance measurement, bronchoalveolar lavage, and lung tissue harvesting 24 hr after injection.Hydrochloric acid instillation induced an inflammatory response in the lungs of wild-type mice, evidenced as increased bronchoalveolar lavage total cells, neutrophils, and total protein; histologic lung injury score; and respiratory system elastance, whereas TNF-alpha receptor I mRNA levels were maintained. These alterations could be prevented by pretreatment with etanercept or genetic deletion of the 55-kd TNF-alpha receptor I, but not by deletion of the TNF-alpha gene. Hydrochloric acid induced a 6-fold increase in apoptotic, caspase 3-positive cells in lung sections from wild-type mice, which was abrogated in mice lacking TNF-alpha receptor I. In immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry studies, HCl stimulated signaling via p44/42 and c-Jun N-terminal kinase, which was blocked in TNF-alpha receptor I knockout mice. In conclusion, ALI induced by HCl requires TNF-alpha receptor I function and associates with activation of downstream proinflammatory signaling pathways p44/42 and c-Jun N-terminal kinase.",

Hydrogen chloride's use in oil and gas well treatment, formation during the burning of many plastics and combustion of fossil fuel, use as a fungicide and slimicide and use in hydraulic fracturing will result in its direct release to the environment. Hydrochloric acid is found in the gases that evolve from volcanoes. Hydrochloric acid is also found in the digestive tract of most mammals. If released to air, hydrogen chloride will be removed by rainfall. If released to soil, it dissociates into chloride and hydronium ions in moist soil. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon a estimated Henry's Law constant of 4.90X10-10 atm-cu m/mole. Hydrogen chloride will evaporate from dry soil surfaces. If released to water, hydrogen chloride dissociates readily in water to chloride and hydronium ions. The dissociation results in a decreasing of the pH of the water. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's Henry's Law constant. Hydrogen chloride does not accumulate in the food chain. Occupational exposure to hydrogen chloride or hydrochloric acid may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with these compounds at workplaces where hydrogen chloride or hydrochloric acid is produced or used. While hydrogen chloride does occur naturally in humans, use data indicate that the general population may be exposed to hydrogen chloride or hydrochloric acid via inhalation and dermal contact with consumer products containing these compounds.

This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic.
